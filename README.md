# PushupCounterPublic
## Introduction
PushupCounter is a simple one page web page that takes some basic pushup (json) data and shows it in chart form.

Please re-use it for your own purposes.

## The future of PushupCounter.com
At PushupCounter.com I will likely be creating a fully blown web app allowing people to log in, regord and share their push up progress but I will continue to maintain this simple web page as well.
